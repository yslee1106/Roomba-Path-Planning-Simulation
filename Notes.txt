Simulation:
-End goal of simulation is the coverage of the whole room (up to 95%)
-Result is the time taken to complete the simulation
-Conduct the simulation for each algorithm 5 times (to be determined) and get the average time
-Compare average simulation times of all the algorithms

Algorithms:
-Random Walk Algorithm
	-The robot moves in a random direction until it encounters an obstacle, then changes direction randomly
	-Example of bad algorithm
-Wall Follow
	-The robot moves along walls or obstacles to clean edges systematically
-Zig Zag Pattern
	-The robot follows a pre-programmed spiral or back-and-forth (zig-zag) pattern to clean systematically
-Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
	-The robot builds a map of the environment using sensors like LiDAR, cameras, or infrared, and determines 	 its position in real-time
-Probabilistic Roadmaps
	-Probabilistic roadmaps generate a graph of possible paths in the environment
	-A* (A-star) finds the shortest path to the target using heuristics
-Coverage Path Planning
	-Ensures systematic coverage by dividing the area into a grid and navigating each cell.
