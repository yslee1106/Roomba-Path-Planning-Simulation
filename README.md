# Roomba-Path-Planning-Simulation
Explored and implemented multiple path-planning algorithms (A*, Boustrophedon, BFS, Spiral) to improve robotic vacuum navigation. Simulated grid-based environments with randomized obstacles, benchmarking algorithms on coverage efficiency, path cost, and computation time.
